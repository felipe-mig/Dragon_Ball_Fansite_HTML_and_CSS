            <h2 id="sypnosys-header">AKIRA TORIYAMA (1955-2024)</h2><br>
            <p class="sypnosys-p"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Toriyama" target="_blank" class="akira-link-wiki"><span class="bold-word">Akira Toriyama</span></a> is the creator of various IP like Dragon Quest, Sand Land, and many other beloved titles. Yet despite having a rich catalog of materials, he was most well-known for creating the critically acclaimed Dragon Ball series. The announcement of his passing shocked the world because the work he did with Dragon Ball spoke to so many people. What you might not realize, though, is how prevalent a shock that loss is to the <span class="bold-word">Hispanic community.</span></p><br>
            <p class="sypnosys-p">A large reason why Dragon Ball resonated with the <span class="bold-word">Hispanic community.</span> At large is because, at its core, Dragon Ball is all about protecting the ones you love while striving to be the best possible version of yourself. At a very young age, most Hispanics are taught that "family is everything and to always help one another." This is exactly what they do in Dragon Ball whenever Goku and the Z-Fighters aren't screaming at the top of their lungs and punching each other in the face.</p><br>
            <div class="at-img1"></div>
            <div class="at-img-subtitle"></div>
                <p class="at-img-subtitle-p">Dragon Ball has inspired so many.</p><br>
            <p class="sypnosys-p">The impact of Dragon Ball hit so close to home in Latin American countries that they began having city-wide screenings for episode # 130 of Dragon Ball Super. These screenings weren't exclusive to Mexico. These screenings were happening all over South America, including Chile, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Bolivia, and several other countries. This became popular enough that Toei Animation, the studio behind Dragon Ball Super, had to issue a statement saying that most of these screenings weren't allowed. This became such a big issue that the Embassy of Japan sent a formal letter asking Mexico not to stream to the masses as they intended. Thankfully, Ciudad Juárez, a city in Mexico, was able to secure the rights to stream it, and as a result, thousands of fans came together to watch the episode.</p><br>
            <p class="sypnosys-p">But the love for Toriyama doesn't stop there. After the news of his passing, people across South America came together to show their love for Toriyama. In a video posted by the Associated Press, we saw hundreds of people in Argentina gathered together at the Obelisk monument in Buenos Aires to honor him one last time. At the event, people raised their hands in the sky, a nod to the series when Goku would summon a Spirit Bomb. A similar thing happened in Zócalo, Mexico, as well.</p><br>

            <div class="at-img-subtitle">
                <p class="at-img-subtitle-p">At its core, Dragon Ball is about family and striving to be better.</p>
            </div><br>
            <p class="sypnosys-p">Although Toriyama may be gone, his legacy will continue to live on. There's not a lot of media that can connect people the way Dragon Ball did and continues to do for countless Hispanics. Because of that, it's something that many <span class="bold-word">Hispanic People</span>, will be forever grateful for. Even though this may not have been his original intention, Dragon Ball became a staple for <span class="bold-word">Hispanic People</span> everywhere while spreading a positive message
