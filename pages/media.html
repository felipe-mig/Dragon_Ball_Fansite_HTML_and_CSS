                    </div> 
                    <p class="seasons-p">Since 1986, there have been 24 theatrical films based on the franchise, including 21 anime films produced by Toei Animation, one official live-action film, and two unofficial films.</p><br>
                    <div class="seasons-image-container-2">

                    </div> 
                    <p class="seasons-p">During the franchise's original broadcast run (1986-1997), Toei produced Dragon Ball films rapidly, in some cases twice per year, to match the Japanese spring and summer vacations. Seventeen films were produced during this period—three Dragon Ball films from 1986 to 1988, thirteen Dragon Ball Z films from 1989 to 1995, and finally a tenth anniversary film that was released in 1996 and adapted the Red Ribbon arc of the original series.[1] These films have a running time below feature length (around 45–60 minutes each) except for the 1996 film, at 80 minutes. These films were mostly alternate retellings of certain story arcs involving new characters or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the same continuity as the manga or TV series.</p><br>
                    <p class="seasons-p">These were generally screened back to back with other Toei films for that season as special theatrical events in Japan. The first through fifth films were shown at the Toei Manga Festival, while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the Toei Anime Fair. By 1996, the first sixteen anime films up until Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon (1995) had sold 50 million tickets and grossed over ¥40 billion ($501 million) at the Japanese box office, making it the highest-grossing anime film series up until then, in addition to selling over 500,000 home video units in Japan.</p><br>
                    <p class="seasons-p">The franchise returned with Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (2013), the first animated film since 1996, and the first produced with the involvement of Akira Toriyama. The film—a sequel to the original series—became the franchise's most successful at the time and was received well by critics, earning an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[11] Unlike the classic event circuit films, those from 2013 onwards were developed with an international theatrical release planned from the beginning by 20th Century Studios (previously known as 20th Century Fox). Battle of Gods was followed by Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' in 2015. The second film introduced Jaco to Dragon Ball, a character who had debuted in Toriyama's spin-off manga Jaco the Galactic Patrolman in 2013.[12] These two movies were adapted by the Dragon Ball Super TV series, with the plotlines from the two films forming multi-episode arcs early in the show's broadcast.</p><br>

                <p class="seasons-p">In the rich tapestry of the manga industry, few titles shine as brightly or hold as much influence as Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball. Since its inception in 1984, this epic saga has not only captivated readers worldwide but has also left an indelible mark on the manga landscape, shaping the industry in profound ways.
                    At its core, Dragon Ball is a quintessential example of the shonen genre, known for its emphasis on action, adventure, and coming-of-age themes. Through the journey of its protagonist, Goku, readers are taken on a rollercoaster ride filled with intense battles, heartwarming friendships, and dramatic character development.</p><br>
                <p class="seasons-p">One of the key factors behind Dragon Ball's enduring success is its masterful blend of elements that appeal to a wide audience.
